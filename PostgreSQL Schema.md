Every database in PostgreSQL contains at least one schema. By default every database contains "public" schema. Schemas are used to logically divide the objects in database. In different schemas we can have tables of the same name. We can manage the permissions to each schema, for example you can add permission to use select in development schema, but deny access to production schema.
